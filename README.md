> [**@jenydu**](https://github.com/jenydu) I like Animal Crossing. My favourite villager is Poppy 🍂🐿️. <img src="https://preview.redd.it/f79f0cv1o7j51.jpg?auto=webp&s=1e572edf80d0eba0c35c77c3c81231d9e626d366" alt="poppy" width="200px">


You can grab the image of your profile picture from your github account. Like any other markdown document, you can add links, images, even emojis 🍋🍰🐸

This is the code I used for writing that line:
